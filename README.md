# Marrow

**Marrow is an open-source library built to turn your robot from a deterministic machine into an intelligent powerhouse.**

With Marrow, instead of simply following pre-programmed instructions, your robot can react and adapt in real-time to what's happening on the field.
Marrow also provides powerful developer tools that simplify setup, testing, and managing complex robot logic - so you can focus on building intelligent behaviors.

Marrow isn't intended to replace other libraries; it's designed to work alongside them.
